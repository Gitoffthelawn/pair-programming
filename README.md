# Effective Pair Programming for Unbelievers

> _If you are doing pair programming, but it is not performing well, you are doing it wrong._

## Motivation

It is important to understand HOW and WHEN to do pair programming. If you are doing pair programming, but it is not performing well, you are doing it wrong.

@TODOs:

- [ ] Add remote pair programming section.
- [ ] Add link to good articles/resources on the internet.
