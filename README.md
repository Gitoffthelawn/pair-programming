# Effective Pair Programming for Unbelievers

> _If you are doing pair programming, but it is not performing well, you are doing it wrong._

## Motivation

This is a copy of a short guideline that I wrote a while ago about doing pair programming for internal use in our teams. It worked quite well in multiple teams, and I thought it worth to share it.

@TODOs:

- [ ] Add remote pair programming section.
- [ ] Add link to good articles/resources on the internet.
