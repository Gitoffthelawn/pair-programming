# Effective Pair Programming

_“Pair programming is an agile software development technique in which two programmers work together at one workstation. One, the driver, writes code while the other, the observer or navigator, reviews each line of code as it is typed in. The two programmers switch roles frequently.” - Wikipedia_

Pairs typically consider better design and quality, they are faster to find the solution and solve problems than programmers working alone, and pair programming dramatically improves knowledge sharing on the team.

### Motivation

I did pair programming for more than two years in my previous job. When I started my new role in a new company, I noticed that my new team does not know how it should work therefore they also didn't quite believed in its benefits. So I began advocating pair programming starting by giving an internal presentation and writing a short guideline base on my experience and all the rules that we have followed in the past two and half years. It worked well, and I thought it worth to share it.

### Why you need a guideline

It turns out many developers sit together behind one desk trying to make it work which often ends up very inefficient and unproductive way of working that only increases man-hours comparing to working individually.

It is important to understand HOW and WHEN to do pair programming.

The closest function to pair-programming is pilot and co-pilot workflow, and it is very interesting because they also have a guideline for it. Where half of it is to make sure it is efficient and effective, and the other half is to ensure that it works for everybody because there has to be disciplined cooperation to make it work for everyone with different soft skills, personality, and in different environments.
