# Setup

The setup guideline is all about to make your pair feel welcome and do pairing effectively.

## Single machine

If you sit with two laptops next to each other working on a single story, it doesn’t mean that you are doing pair programming.

Use one machine, with two pairs of mouse and keyboard. You are not allowed to swap one mouse and keyboard.

- Makes it easier to switch. (Often you need to take control for a few seconds)
- The navigator feels more welcome to take control.
- Reduces the chance to get distracted.
- Works for everyone. (ex: Some developers will hesitate to take control. Some developers don't like when others - use their mouse and keyboard.)

Even for a simple task like when the navigator wants to use Google to find an answer, it still must happen in the same machine. By doing that you will make sure that your pair doesn’t lose the context. And also a simple task like finding an answer is a skill and an opportunity for your pair to see how you do it.

> _Note: Having multiple mouses and keyboards is supported by all operating systems. The most comfortable option is to have a keyboard and mouse combo with a wireless dongle. So you can plug and connect._

## Fair tools

Choose an editor/operating-system that both of you know how to use or it’s more common to use in the team. (Nothing in common? then use the one which has an easier learning curve.)

Developers with highly customized setup must have their pairing profile or even pairing station if needed. (Pairing station is a machine dedicated to doing pair programming.)

## Share space

Share equal space on your desk (fifty-fifty) and keep your desk clean to have space for an extra keyboard and mouse.

If you are pairing on your desk, your pair is responsible for bringing his mouse and keyboard, and you are responsible for doing the cable/connection work.

If the navigator sits on the side, you cannot pair effectively and he or she can’t follow your work. Eventually, the navigator will be tired, bored, or distracted.

These disciplines are required to keep it fair, organized, and workable for everyone.

## No private display

The screen must be equally visible to both navigator and driver. You are not allowed to use a separate display. You cannot use your laptop’s keyboard if you have to use its display.

Two monitor with mirror display enabled is a good idea, but you will need more practice to learn how to point objects on the screen for the driver.
