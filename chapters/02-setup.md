# Setup

The setup guideline is all about to make your pair feel welcome and do pairing effectively.

## Single machine

If you sit with two laptops next to each other working on a single story, it doesn’t mean that you are doing pair programming.

Use one machine, with two pairs of mouse and keyboard. (You are not allowed to swap one mouse and keyboard)

If navigator wants to use Google to find an answer, it also must happen on the same machine.

The main reason to have two sets of mouse and keyboard is to make it easier to switch. Remember you also want to make sure your pair feels welcome and to contribute productively.

> _Note: Having multiple mouses and keyboards is supported by all operating systems. The most comfortable option is to have a keyboard and mouse combo with a wireless dongle. So you can plug and connect._

## Fair tools

Choose an editor and operating-system that both of you know how to use or it’s more common to use in the team. (Nothing in common? then use the one which has a more natural learning curve.)

Developers with highly customized setup must have their pairing profile or even pairing station if needed. (Pairing station is a machine dedicated to doing pair programming, and this chapter does not cover it.)

## Share space

Share equal space on your desk (fifty-fifty) and keep your desk clean to have space for an extra keyboard and mouse.

If the navigator sits on the side, you cannot pair effectively, and he or she can’t follow and focus on your work. Eventually, the navigator gets bored or distracted.

Whenever you are pairing on your desk, your pair is responsible for bringing a pair mouse and keyboard, and you are responsible for doing the cable/connection work. Again, to make sure your pair feels welcome and also to keep it comfortable for yourself. Moreover, some people don't like anyone to move stuff around on their desk.

## No private display

The screen must be equally visible to both navigator and driver. You are not allowed to use a separate display. You cannot use your laptop’s keyboard if you have to use its display.

Two monitor with mirror display enabled is a good idea, but you need some practice learning how to point objects on screen for the driver.
