# Driving and Navigating

Start driving, work for 30 minutes without distraction, switch your role with the navigator. Navigate for another 30 minutes without distraction, take a break. Repeat.

## How long I drive?

Driver role must turn every 30 minutes. You can not change turn only because you know that part of code better than the current driver. As a navigator, you always talk to the driver about what is in your head. If the driver fails to understand what you want, you could ask to take control, but only temporary. That does not mean switching control.

## Taking/giving control

Always ask to take/give control. You never start using your keyboard/mouse even if the driver is not using his keyboard/mouse at the moment.

Taking control is your last option. You do it only when the driver can’t understand what is in navigator’s head or navigator fails to explain it.

Note 1: If you are doing it a lot, and it is not decreasing there is something wrong with your communication.

Note 2: If the expert takes control in the same step over and over, there is something wrong with knowledge sharing. Make sure you explain why and what you are doing.

## Switch driver

Switching driver is essential to keep pairing productive. Even if it’s expert-novice, you must switch driver every 30 minutes.

Same as taking control, you always ask for switching driver. As driver or navigator, you can always remind your pair when it’s time to switch driver.

## Break time

Repeat these two steps:

1.  Start pair programming and after a two-time switch, take a short break (5 minutes)
2.  Start working again and after another two-time switch, take a long break (15 minutes)

These steps designed to make sure it’ll move both pairs between focused and diffuse modes.

Being punctual is important; your pair can't sit and wait for you after finishing his short-break.

If you need more time for any reason, try to schedule it for your long break and let your pair know about it earlier. Make the decision together so if your pair has something important to do, he/she can also sync it with you.

Note: When you switch your role as driver to the navigator, it doesn't mean that you are on break time. Navigator must use his full attention to the work and usually his/her brain is more productive than the driver.

> Pro tips: Do something fun during your break and do not talk about the work. It takes you to diffuse mode and gives a reward to your brain. It works like magic.

## Thinking out loud

The navigator must know what is in your mind or what you are going to do. Talk before doing. You learn it with more practice.

## Alt+Tab

The driver always makes sure that the navigator is following his work.

Be careful about doing fast Alt+Tab. It must be easy for your pair to follow you.

For instance, usually, the expert has a trained eye to read a window full of the project’s logs. In this case, the expert must point it to the novice instead of checking and switching back. Don't forget your goals.

## Distractions

As a driver, while pairing, You are in pair programming profile, and it is a shared station now. You cannot click on Slack’s notifications or chat with a friend because it kills navigator’s focus.
You postpone other stuff, and you do not review unrelated work or pull requests.

As a navigator, while pairing, You should not play with your phone, even if the driver is doing routine work.

## Navigating

As the role suggests, the navigator is the brain to review, find issues, and help to solve problems. Possibly because you are not spending some of your brain's capacity into typing and controlling, you do a better job at verifying and giving direction or finding solutions.

Keep your focus into code. If the driver is doing a poor job and not explaining himself, it is your responsibility to remind him and challenge him by asking questions. Make sure you understand what he/she is doing. Ask for an extra explanation if necessary.
