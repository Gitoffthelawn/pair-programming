# Workflow

## Which machine to start

There is no hard rule for it. Does novice have project setup on his/her machine? If not, probably it is the best opportunity to do it. Novice may drive first, and navigator shows him/her how to set up the project to make sure novice learns how to setup it herself.

## Project introduction

In an expert-novice scenario, if it’s the first time for the novice to work on the project, a project introduction is required by the expert.

The expert starts driving first and gives an introduction to project structure, how to run/test the project.

Expert is responsible for sharing his knowledge about the project.

## Who starts to drive first

In an expert-novice scenario, it is always better if novice drive first. This way you make sure novice learns what is going on and can get to the speed faster.

In an expert-expert or novice-novice, station owner may start first, and it is an opportunity for the pair to get familiar with the environment.

## Problem making a decision

Pairs always have to try to convince one another when there are different points of view or ideas. Design decisions, for example.

It won’t happen a lot, but if you can’t agree which idea is better, ask a third person to join and hear both ideas to help you to make the right decision.

## When pairing is not a good idea

While one of our goals is sharing knowledge, we don't want to kill team's productivity and efficiency. It is effortless to get what is the right thing to do. I give you a few examples.

Reminder: _as we said earlier, novice and expert are relative levels of expertise on the task, not the general skills and experience and it has nothing to do with senior and junior._

**Trivial tasks** - If it is a trivial task, perhaps it is not a good idea to have expert-expert pairing together since they won't achieve enough comparing to the resource they are taking from the team.

**Complex problems** - In this case, if you already have an expert on your team, it is not a good idea to have novice-novice pairing together. When you need fast results, expert-expert is what you need. Otherwise, the expert-novice is the most efficient, and it assures that right data to be shared with another team member, and soon you have an extra expert on that topic.

**New problems** - A new problem means there is no expert. Just make sure at least one of the pairs is a senior member of the team to ensure they make better decisions along the way.
